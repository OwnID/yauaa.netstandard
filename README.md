This is a .NET porting of Java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

You can see the original project at this link: https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa

The library has been completely rewritten in C# from scratch to be optimized and .NET friendly 

A bit more background about this useragent parser can be found in this blog which the author Niels Basjes wrote about it: [https://techlab.bol.com/making-sense-user-agent-string/](https://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=2171&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechlab.bol.com%2Fmaking-sense-user-agent-string%2F&name=yauaa)

The Java documentation can be found here https://yauaa.basjes.nl, soon will be provided a .NET documentation specific for this project

You can download the .nuget package there: https://www.nuget.org/packages/OrbintSoft.Yauaa.NetStandard

## Example output

As an example the useragent of a phone:

    Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Nexus 6 Build/NBD90Z) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.124 Mobile Safari/537.36

is converted into this set of fields:
